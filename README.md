# Fetin 2024 Project

The SherLock Project aims to automate the retrieval of e-commerce purchases, providing customers with a practical and secure solution. With a simple QR Code, customers can unlock a compartment in smart lockers located in strategic spots such as universities and supermarkets, making package pickups more convenient. This is especially beneficial for those who face challenges in receiving home deliveries.

In this project, I explored key technical concepts in embedded systems, such as:

🌟 FreeRTOS: To manage QR Code scanning on the ESP32CAM and retrieve customer information via the API on the ESP32.

🔒 ESP-NOW: For wireless communication between the ESP32 and ESP32CAM, ensuring security with encryption and pairing logic on the same WiFi channel.

🌐 OTA (Over The Air): For firmware updates via a web interface, simplifying support and maintenance.

📄 HTML: To create pages that allow parameter reconfiguration and compartment unlocking.
💾 EEPROM: For storing WiFi connection configurations and customer data.

📡 Communication Protocols: Including I2C, SPI, and HTTP for device and API interactions.

On the Backend, we used:

- Java with Spring Boot: To develop the API.

- RabbitMQ: For messaging.

- PostgreSQL: As the database.

- Docker: To streamline integration and deployment.

SherLock not only challenged my skills but also provided a rich learning experience in innovative technologies.
